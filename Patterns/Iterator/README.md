# Iterator

**Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that allows sequetial traversal through a complex data structure without exposing its internal details.**

Thanks to the Iterator, client ca go over elements of different collections in a similar fashion using a single iterator interface.

## Example

Straight traversal and reverse traversal of a collection of string items using IEnumerator and IEnumerable interfaces.
