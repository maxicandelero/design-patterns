# Observer

**Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.**

The Observer pattern provides a way to subscribe and unsubscribe to and from these events for any object that implements a subscriber interface.

## Example  

The Observer pattern is pretty common in C# code, especially in the GUI components. It provides a way to react to events happening in other objects without coupling to their classes.
