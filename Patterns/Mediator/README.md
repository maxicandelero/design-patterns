# Mediator

**Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that reduces coupling between components of a program by making them communicate indirectly, through a special mediator object.**

The Mediator makes it easy to modify, extend and reuse individual components because they're no longer dependent on the dozens of other classes.

## Example

The most popular usage of the Mediator pattern in C# code is facilitating communications between GUI components of an app. The synonym of the Mediator is the Controller part of MVC pattern.
