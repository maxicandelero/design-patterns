# State

**State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.**

The pattern extracts state-related behaviors into separate state classes and forces the original object to delegate the work to an instance of these classes, instead of acting on its own.

## Example

The State pattern is commonly used in C# to convert massive switch-base state machines into objects.
