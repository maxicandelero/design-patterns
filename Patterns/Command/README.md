# Command

**Command is behavioral design pattern that converts requests or simple operations into objects.**

The conversion allows deferred or remote execution of commands, storing command history, etc.

## Example

Letâ€™s say we want to provide a File System utility with methods to open, write and close file. This file system utility should support multiple operating systems such as Windows and Unix.
