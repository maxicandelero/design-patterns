# Gang of Four Design Patterns (in C#)

This project was created with the idea to have some examples on the design patterns application. It's based in the documentation that you can find in [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/csharp), some examples were changed in order to have a bit more real implementation (they were extracted from [here](https://medium.com/@analempert/10-design-patterns-with-day-to-day-examples-e4f256d8439)). **You can execute the unit test cases in order to validate the code** (xUnit is being used).

Over 20 years ago the iconic computer science book “[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0201633612&linkCode=as2&tag=triatcraft-20&linkId=XRGUDJCGWC6AJNZM)” was first published. The four authors of the book: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, have since been dubbed “The Gang of Four”. In technology circles, you’ll often see this nicknamed shorted to GoF. Even though the GoF Design Patterns book was published over 20 years ago, it still continues to be an Amazon best seller.

The GoF wrote the book in a C++ context, but the design patterns are not unique to this one. The design patterns can be applied in any object oriented language.

The GoF Design Patterns are broken into three categories: Creational Patterns for the creation of objects; Structural Patterns to provide relationship between objects; and finally, Behavioral Patterns to help define how objects interact.

## Creational Patterns

* [Abstract Factory](Patterns/AbstractFactory)

* [Builder](Patterns/Builder)

* [Factory Method](Patterns/FactoryMethod)

* [Prototype](Patterns/Prototype)

* [Singleton](Patterns/Singleton)
